CSS Course on Frontend Masters

This repository contains the code I wrote while taking a CSS course on Frontend Masters. Throughout the course, I learned how to use CSS to style text, create navigation bars and headers/footers, and even add icons to my website. I also gained a deeper understanding of design concepts and responsive design using HTML and both CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid.

As part of the course, I built a simple portfolio site to practice and showcase my design skills, with the layout created using CSS Grid. Please note that this site is not my main portfolio, but rather a project I completed as part of the course to improve my design abilities.

Overall, I found this course to be a great way to expand my skill set and learn new techniques for building beautiful, functional websites. I hope that the code in this repository will be helpful to others who are interested in improving their CSS skills, including those looking to learn how to use CSS Grid in their own projects.
